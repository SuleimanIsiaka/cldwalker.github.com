title: About Me
---
I'm passionate about knowledge management, tagging, ruby and rails. One day I hope to bring back that passion back to physics.

*I'm available for hire*. I'm particularly interested in ruby and/or rails work that involves knowledge management, tagging or physics. "Here's my resume":http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dhjdhqhp_4sdt4jmhp.
